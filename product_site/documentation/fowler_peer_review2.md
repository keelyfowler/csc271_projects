## peer review summary & response

### peer review summary
during the web expo, visitors reviewed my mindracer product site and provided feedback on design, readability, navigation consistency, accessibility, and potential feature expansions. classmates noted strengths in the visual style, cohesive color palette, responsiveness, and overall concept. suggestions focused on improving text clarity, header alignment, link readability, and considering long term features like user accounts and mood based interface variations

### changes implemented after review


## typography & readability
 classmates noted that some text was difficult to read.  
i increased base font sizes, improved spacing, and improved contrast to strengthen readability across screen sizes.


## nav consistency
feedback noted that the header shifted visually between pages.  
i standardized the nav bar by balancing out the spacing, link styling, and mobile wrapping behavior so it remains centered and consistent

## accessibility improvements++
 classmates pointed out minor accessibility issues.  
i added missing alt text, improved interactive element contrast, and increased padding to support clearer touch targets and better visibility

## decision builder layout adj
some of my classmates mentioned that parts of the decision tree layout felt dense.  
i improved content hierarchy, spacing, and padding inside the main content box to create a better flow

### future feature considerations
quite a few suggestions recc'd features outside the scope of this course like including:
--> user login or saved mood log history  
--> visual diagram representations of the decision tree  
--> additional mood based ui adaptations  

i would love to implement these in future versions once i learn backend things like databases, authentication, and server side storage. they're strong recommendations that i was also thinking along the lines of for a later version

### conclusion
the peer review offered valuable insights that led to improvements in clarity, consistency, accessibility, and overall usability. the updates strengthened the final version while leaving space for expansion of my site & its features once additional technologies are learned !
