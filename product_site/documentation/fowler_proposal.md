# Product Proposal - Keely Fowler
I redid this product proposal for the final project, since I was missing some parts per rubric - business ideas & brainstorming

~

## Part 2 A: Business Idea Types

 1. Which type of ideas do you think apply to Shyp? Why? 

Shyp is a problem-first startup. They noticed shipping is a pain..finding boxes, packing stuff, comparing carriers, waiting in line. People avoid shipping things because of the hassle. They identified this as problem first, then built their solution around it: an on-demand service where you just take a photo and someone picks it up/ packs it /  ships it for you.

 2. Which type of ideas do you think apply to Curofy? Why? 

Curofy is also problem-first; doctors need quick answers from coworkers/teammates for urgent cases/second opinions, but typical communication like phone calls/ emails/paging can be slow and inefficient. Since healthcare is time sensitive, they built a secure social network exclusively for doctors (verified w licenses) to share cases and get fast responses. They started with the problem of doctors that aren't connected, & created a solution which was the platform.



## Part 2 A (continued): Brainstorming

 1. Brainstorm ideas of problems you want to solve with software like an app or website. 

Problems I considered:
- Decision paralysis when overwhelmed (especially with ADHD/anxiety)
- Mood tracking that doesn't lead anywhere useful
- Too many productivity apps that make things worse
- Not knowing what coping mechanism will actually help in the moment
- Feeling stuck and not knowing how to become unstuck
- The "rotting" cycle where you can't start any task

 2. Brainstorm ways to solve the problems. 

Solutions I thought about:
- Simple todo list → rejected, too basic and doesn't address the root cause
- AI decides everything for you → rejected, removes control and feels wrong
-  Interactive decision tree with custom branches → picked this one 
- Meditation/mindfulness app → helpful but doesn't solve practical decisions
- Standard mood journal → just data collection with no actionable help
-  Mood tracker that suggests coping strategies → integrated this 
- Gamified tracking with rewards → rejected, felt manipulative
- Another unified productivity platform → rejected, too broad and everyone's doing it
-  Customizable tool that adapts to individual → integrated this 

 3. Choose one of your ideas as your product. Why did you pick this idea over the other candidates? 

I chose the  decision tree approach  because:
- I actually live with this problem every day, so I know what doesn't work
- When I'm stuck, I need pathways to follow, not another blank todo list
- It adapts to me specifically, my triggers aren't the same as everyone else's
- Most productivity apps assume you can think logically when you're overwhelmed, which misses the whole point
- Over time it helps you see patterns in what makes you stuck and what actually helps

 4. Is your idea a new one or has it existed before? 

It's a new combination of existing pieces. Decision trees, mood tracking, and productivity tools all exist separately, but nobody's combined customizable emotional decision trees with action based coping strategies specifically for executive dysfunction.

Unlike meditation apps (Headspace, Calm) that just help you relax, or companion apps (Finch) that do general self-care, MindRacer helps you make the first decision when you're paralyzed and can't start anything.

 5. What industry would your idea be useful in? Why? 

 Mental Health Technology  ~ specifically digital self-management tools.

Why this industry:
- Mental health app usage is exploding, especially for ADHD/executive dysfunction
- People want daily self-management tools, not just therapy
- Everything in mental health tech is moving toward personalization and customization
- Digital tools give support to people who can't access or afford traditional therapy
- There's real demand for executive dysfunction tools

Also touches  Productivity Software  since it helps people actually do things, but it's different because it addresses the emotional barriers first, not just organizing tasks.

## Part 2 B: Product Proposal

 1. Describe the product you have come up with and the type(s) of ideas that apply to it. 

The product I have come up with is called  MindMap  or  RaceMyMind .

This idea comes from issues I have dealt with for most of my life. I have constantly struggled with curating my day, whether that means waking up and journaling, listening to music, deciding it is time to redesign the wheel, or choosing to rot in bed for the rest of the day.

Many people struggle to manage anxious or overwhelming thoughts, while anxiety or other neurotypical blockades pose a real threat. When people (myself included, anecdotally) enter a conflicting moment where they feel as though they should be doing many tasks, but simultaneously feel as though they can only perform one task in a way that blocks all others, it leads to "rotting." That lost feeling throughout the day, where nothing seems possible, is what makes a person feel stuck.

This product is meant to relieve that pressure and the cycle of anxiety when someone is stuck, and help them become unstuck. It is an app and a decision maker that is rewarding, recursive, and reinforcing.

This product is aimed to relieve the pressure and perpetuating anxiety felt by those when they're stuck, to become unstuck.

This is an app ~ this is a decision maker that's rewarding, recursive, and reinforcing.

Once you enter the app, you're presented with a limited, finite number of options:

1. Feeling expressive?
   - if yes,
     - feel free to add new moods
     - add new behaviors that pair with different moods

2. Feeling enough?
   - if yes,
     - Choose your mood (default or custom)
     - Choose hobbies or activities that match that mood and upcoming plans (AI calendar integration)
     - Depending on the hobby chosen, trigger a chain of commands (for example, yoga → yoga video, music → shuffle playlist, journaling → open notes doc)

This tool is built to feel flexible but structured, with branching pathways that help guide decisions...

 Type of idea:  This is a  Simplify  idea - it makes the process of decision-making much easier when you're overwhelmed. It's also  problem-first  because it starts with the specific problem of decision paralysis and executive dysfunction.

 2. How is your product personally relevant to you? 

This product is extremely personal.. I've dealt with decision paralysis and executive dysfunction my entire life. The "rotting" feeling where you know you should do things but can't start any of them is something I experience regularly. I'm building this because I need it myself, and I know firsthand what doesn't work about existing productivity and mental health apps.

 3. What problem will your product solve? 

Many people struggle to manage anxious or overwhelming thoughts in a clear, structured way. Anxiety often comes from simple unmet needs like food, sleep, or hydration, but when these are not recognized, people spiral into indecision and emotional clutter. This product is an interactive tool that helps users map emotions, triggers, and needs into decision-based/decisive pathways. It takes messy input (like stress/emotions) and outputs form-function solutions (coping mechanisms/routines).

 4. What type of website will your product be? 

This website will be a combination of blog, with anecdotal evidence of individuals using the platform for self-betterment. Visually, it will read like a blog, but inherently be a form of advertisement to showcase the product's features. The website will be a  hybrid of blog and business .

 5. Is your product a painkiller or a vitamin? 

This product is a  vitamin .

This product could never fix the neurotypical issues I, as well as millions of others face when trying to enhance their productivity for the day. This is a product that is meant to blanket certain issues on a day by day basis - but stands apart where the decisions it creates for the user are entirely dependent upon how the user sets it up to be.

 6. Is your product easy to monetize? 

MindRacer is a difficult product to monetize, since it capitalizes on those who feel inadequate emotionally/mentally and may need a crutch to help perform their tasks. Optional premium features could be explored later, such as integrations with productivity apps or advanced customization.

 7. Is your product simple and easy to describe? 

Yes. The app is unique because of its  customizability . Every user creates their own branches, moods, and routines, so no two experiences are the same. Unlike a generic productivity app, this tool is shaped by the individual.

 8. Who will be the likely users of your product? Does your product have a large market? 

The likely users are people who struggle with:
- Decision paralysis
- Executive dysfunction
- ADHD
- Anxiety
- Depression
- Feeling overwhelmed by daily tasks

This is a large market - millions of people deal with executive dysfunction, especially those with ADHD, autism, depression, and anxiety disorders. The neurodiversity and mental health support market is rapidly growing.

 9. Does your product have a legitimate secret sauce? 

Yes - the  customizability and recursive design .

 Visual tree: 
- Users select their current state (anxious, tired, sad, restless, etc.)
- The program asks context-based questions (time of day or food intake/sleep etc)
- At each decision point, the user is guided to the next step, branching into common causes (hunger, PMD, hydration, burnout, hormonal, overstimulation)
- Once common causes are exhausted, the app can suggest coping strategies or journaling prompts
- Users can customize and add new branches over time, making the tool flexible and personal

 Key Features: 
-  Decision-tree emotional mapping : Flow-chart style navigation for moods, triggers, and needs
-  Adaptive UI : Visuals change depending on emotional state
-  Action Suggestions : Tailored coping strategies, routines, or reframes depending on context
-  Recursive Design : Supports backtracking and reusing nodes, helping users recognize recurring causes of anxiety
-  Customization : Users can build their own branches, routines, and coping maps over time
-  Expansion Potential : Could integrate physical habits, journaling, music

 Value Proposition: 
- Provides structure for internal chaos the same way planners organize external tasks
- Encourages self-awareness by helping users track patterns and recurrent triggers
- Bridges emotional regulation with logical systems, making emotions easier to navigate
- Can be expanded into broader habit/routine management (food, sleep, productivity, etc)
