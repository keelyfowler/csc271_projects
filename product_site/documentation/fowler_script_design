<!-- AI USAGE NOTE - i used LLM for writing out and brainstorming ideas, 
i sometimes struggle narrowing down my plan /try to do too much things at once, so it was very helpful in tht regard -->

script idea:
!!! page to edit: decision_tree.html
this script powers the “mindracer activity finder” on the decision tree page. the user answers two quick questions about energy and time, clicks the button, and the page returns a customized activity suggestion. it also gives subtle ui feedback by changing background colors and optionally revealing a short meditation video when energy is low. this keeps the page interactive with a point and click feedback like system 
where it lives: the decision tree page (decision_tree.html), with code in js/decisiontree.js and styles in css/main.css.

it: 
- reads the user’s selections from two dropdowns
- calculates a score and maps it to a suggestion
- updates the page with the suggestion text and conditional ui changes
- shows or hides a meditation section for low energy
- unlocks follow-up action buttons so the page feels responsive


goals:
- make decision making feel fast / lightweight
- give the user a clear suggestion based on energy and time
- add gentle visual feedback with background color changes
- reveal a meditation prompt only when it makes sense (low energy)
- keep the dom updates simple and accessible
- leave room for future expansion like more ideas and a  tree preview

task breakdown
- get references to all dropdowns, buttons, headings, and display areas
- wait for the user to click “race my mind →”
- read the selected energy and time levels
- validate that both are chosen before continuing
- calculate a score from those two inputs
- match the score to a suggestion message
- update the page visually / textually.. change background color, insert suggestion text, and show or hide the meditation section as needed
- display the results container and re-enable any previously disabled buttons
- if the user clicks “save preferences,” store the tree name and visually confirm the save

page elements to be selected
-getElementById:energyLevel, timeAvailable, getSuggestionBtn, suggestionResult, activitySuggestion, meditationSection, meditationHeading, resetBtn, moreBtn, treeCustomizer, tree-name
-getElementsByClassName: form-label (labels styled or strike thru), button-group /action button , content-box 
-getElementsByTagName: used for p (paragraphs on page) and button 
-querySelector: used for h1 (page heading), .card-right h2 (customizer heading), and .content-box ( change background color)
-querySelectorAll: used w/ #decisionTreeForm label (loop to style all labels), .button-group button (enable or disable real buttons), and #decisionTreeForm select (optional batch reset or focus)
